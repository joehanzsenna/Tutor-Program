CSS Pseudo-classes

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

* Anchor Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:

/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}

Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

* Hover on <div>
An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a <div> element:
  div:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}

* Simple Tooltip Hover
Hover over a <div> element to show a <p> element (like a tooltip):

What are Pseudo-Elements?

* The ::first-line Pseudo-element
The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text.

The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> elements:

  Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element:

font properties
color properties
background properties
word-spacing
letter-spacing

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
