Brief History of the web

Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this was formalised as a management proposal in November 1990. This outlined the principal concepts and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”.By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer. To prevent it being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"


What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web page
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


Html Elements :-

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

TYPES OF Elements :-

 HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.

Html tags :-

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:


HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>



HTML Attributes :-

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

Types of Attributes ----

The href Attribute :-

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
    Example -:
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Visit Facebook</a>

The src Attribute :-

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

    Example -:
        <img src="img_girl.jpg">

The width and height Attributes :-

The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

    Example
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">


The alt Attribute :-

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

    Example
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">


The style Attribute :-

The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>


The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>


The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.


We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Good:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Bad:
<a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example
<p title=About W3Schools>


Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

     Summary

The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element




Images :-

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

Syntax
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">



The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">

Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">


Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:

Example
<img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">


Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514432324607-a09d9b4aefdd?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxleHBsb3JlLWZlZWR8MTB8fHxlbnwwfHx8fHw%3D&w=1000&q=80" alt="Coffee">


Notes on external images: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; they can suddenly be removed or changed.


Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>


Chapter Summary
Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right



*  HTML Links

Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!


HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.


HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Example
Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

 Summary
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program'
