What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

How To Add CSS
When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element.

CSS Selectors:-
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

types of Selectors
Simple Selectors :-
*Element Selector
*id selector
*class selector

grouping selectors
universal Selector
combinators selector
psuedo class-Selector
psuedo element-Selector

The element Selector:-
The element selector is the html tag name, just like calling your h1,p,div etc.

The CSS id Selector:-
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

The CSS class Selector:-
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

The CSS Grouping Selector:-
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions) so they'll be styled together

h1,h2,p {

}

The CSS Universal Selector:-
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.


CSS Combinators
A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

CSS Pseudo-classes

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

* Anchor Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:

/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}

Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

* Hover on <div>
An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a <div> element:
  div:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}


* Simple Tooltip Hover
Hover over a <div> element to show a <p> element (like a tooltip):

*  CSS - The :first-child and :last-child Pseudo-class
The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.

use ul li as example

Match the first <p> element
In the following example, the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element:


* CSS Pseudo-elements

What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

* The ::first-line Pseudo-element
The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text.

The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> elements:

  Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

The following properties apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element:

font properties
color properties
background properties
word-spacing
letter-spacing
text-decoration
vertical-align
text-transform
line-height
clear

Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

The ::first-letter Pseudo-element
The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.

The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> elements:

font properties
color properties
background properties
margin properties
padding properties
border properties
text-decoration
text-transform
line-height


CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element
The ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element:
  Example
h1::before {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}


  CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element
The ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element.

The following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element:

  Example
h1::after {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}


* The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:
Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

Width and Height of an Element
In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.
Example
This <div> element will have a total width of 350px:

div {
  width: 320px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  margin: 0;
}

Here is the calculation:
320px (width)
+ 20px (left + right padding)
+ 10px (left + right border)
+ 0px (left + right margin)
= 350px

The total width of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
The total height of an element should be calculated like this:

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
