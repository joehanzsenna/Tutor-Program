<!-- Introduction to Javascript -->

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.

What Is JavaScript? JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.

*JavaScript Variables

Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.
They are automatically declared when first used:
Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
From the examples you can guess:
x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11

Example using var
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

// variable declare with var, can be re-declared and reassigned
var birthday = "tuesday"
console.log(birthday);
var birthday = "wednesday"
console.log(birthday);
birthday = "Thursday"
console.log(birthday);

Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

Example using let
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

Example using const
const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;

Mixed Example
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;

The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
These are constant values and cannot be changed.
The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
The value total can be changed.

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Just like in algebra, variables hold values:

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:
let z = x + y;


*JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.


*The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

x = x + 5

In JavaScript, however, This makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

Note
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.


**JavaScript Data Types
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Object
8. Array


<!-- Examples
// Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25"); -->


Note
A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.
The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

let x = 16 + "Volvo";


**JavaScript Strings
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

Example
// Using double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

// Using single quotes:
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';

You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

Example
// Single quote inside double quotes:
let answer1 = "It's alright";

// Single quotes inside double quotes:
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

// Double quotes inside single quotes:
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

***JavaScript BigInt
JavaScript BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
JavaScript Integer Accuracy
JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits:

JavaScript Integer Accuracy
JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits:
How to Create a BigInt
To create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer or call BigInt():




**JavaScript Numbers
All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Example
// With decimals:
let x1 = 34.00;

// Without decimals:
let x2 = 34;


**JavaScript Booleans
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
let z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false

Booleans are often used in conditional testing.


<!-- **JavaScript Arrays
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
Array items are separated by commas.
The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

*The typeof Operator
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

Example
typeof ""             // Returns "string"
typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"

Example
typeof 0              // Returns "number"
typeof 314            // Returns "number"
typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
typeof (3)            // Returns "number"
typeof (3 + 4)        // Returns "number" -->

**Undefined
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
Example
let car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined

Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

Example
car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined

Empty Values
An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
Example
let car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"


**Null
The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.

// foo is known to exist now but it has no type or value:
const foo = null;
foo; //null


typeof null; // "object" (not "null" for legacy reasons)
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
null === undefined; // false
null == undefined; // true
null === null; // true
null == null; // true


**Objects
The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date

Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
In real life, a car is an object.
A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

Objects are variables too. just like you assign "Toyota" to car
let car = "Toyota";
But objects can contain many values.
This code assigns many values (Toyota, Camry, white) to a variable named car:

const car = {type:"Toyota", model:"Camry", color:"white"};

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

Accessing Object Properties
You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName

objectName["propertyName"]

Example1
person.lastName;

Example2
person["lastName"];

**JavaScript Arrays

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

Why Use Arrays?
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";

However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
The solution is an array!
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:
It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

Example
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

Example
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";

Accessing Array Elements
You access an array element by referring to the index number:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];

Note: Array indexes start with 0.

[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

Changing an Array Element
This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

cars[0] = "Opel";
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";

Converting an Array to a String
The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values.

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();
Result:

Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

Access the Full Array
With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name:

Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;

Arrays are Objects
Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:

Array:
const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];

Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John:

Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};

Array Elements Can Be Objects
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:


The length Property
The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length;

<!-- lets have a pause on Objects for now let's look into strings, we'll come back to objects later -->

JavaScript String Methods

we have different types of string methods but i'll walk you through some of them

String length
String slice()
String toUpperCase()
String toLowerCase()


JavaScript String Length
The length property returns the length of a string:

Example
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;


JavaScript String slice()
slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included).

Example
Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13:

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7, 13);


Examples
If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7);

If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string:

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12);

This example slices out a portion of a string from position -12 to position -6:

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12, -6);

JavaScript String toUpperCase()
Example
let text1 = "Hello World!";
let text2 = text1.toUpperCase();

JavaScript String toLowerCase()
Example
let text1 = "Hello World!";       // String
let text2 = text1.toLowerCase();  // text2 is text1 converted to lower

JavaScript String indexOf()
Examples
Search a string for "welcome":
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
let result = text.indexOf("welcome");

Search a string for "Welcome":

let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
let result = text.indexOf("Welcome");

Find the first occurrence of "e":

let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
text.indexOf("e");

let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
text.indexOf("e", 5);



---JavaScript String concat()
javascript concatenation is joining two strings together
Overview. String Concatenation in JavaScript simply means appending one or more strings to the end of another string. For example, Concatenating string - "World" at the end of string "Hello " makes the final string as "Hello World".

Examples
Join two strings:

let text1 = "sea";
let text2 = "food";
let result = text1.concat(text2);

Join two strings:

let text1 = "Hello";
let text2 = "world!";
let result = text1.concat(" ", text2);

Description
The concat() method joins two or more strings.
The concat() method does not change the existing strings.
The concat() method returns a new string.

Join three strings:

let text1 = "Hello";
let text2 = "world!";
let text3 = "Have a nice day!";
let result = text1.concat(" ", text2, " ", text3);

JavaScript Numbers
JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
Example
let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
let y = 3;       // A number without decimals

Adding Numbers and Strings
WARNING !!
JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.
Example
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

If you add two strings, the result will be a string concatenation:

Example
let x = "10";
let y = "20";
let z = x + y;

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation:

Example
let x = 10;
let y = "20";
let z = x + y;

A common mistake is to expect this result to be 30:
lets try this out
Example
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "The result is: " + x + y;

A common mistake is to expect this result to be 102030:

Example
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "30";
let result = x + y + z;

Numeric Strings
JavaScript strings can have numeric content:

let x = 100;         // x is a number

let y = "100";       // y is a string

JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations:

This will work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y;

This will also work:

let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x * y;




---JavaScript Template Literals

Back-Tics Syntax
Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:
let text = `Hello World!`;
let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;

Multiline Strings
Template literals allows multiline strings:

Example
let text =
`The quick
brown fox
jumps over
the lazy dog`;

Interpolation
Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is called string interpolation.

The syntax is:

${...}

Variable Substitutions
Template literals allow variables in strings:

Example
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;

Expression Substitution
Template literals allow expressions in strings:

Example
let price = 10;
let VAT = 0.25;

let total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`;

<!-- HTML Templates
Example
let header = "Templates Literals";
let tags = ["template literals", "javascript", "es6"];

let html = `<h2>${header}</h2><ul>`;
for (const x of tags) {
  html += `<li>${x}</li>`;
}

html += `</ul>`; -->


---JavaScript Operators
Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
String Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Ternary Operators
Type Operators

JavaScript Assignment
The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:
Assignment Examples
let x = 10;
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
Assignment
let x = 10;
x += 5;

JavaScript Addition
The Addition Operator + adds numbers:
The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:
Adding
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
JavaScript String Addition
The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example
let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;

Adding Strings and Numbers
Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

Example
let x = 5 + 5;
let y = "5" + 5;
let z = "Hello" + 5;

JavaScript Multiplication
The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers:

Multiplying
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;

JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator	Description
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not


JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Arithmetic Operators Example
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;


JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators

Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.


Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:
(==) equal to
x == "5"	true
x == 5	true
x == 8	false

===	equal value and equal type
	x === 5	true
  x === "5"	false

!=	not equal
  x != 8	true
  x !== 5	false

!==	not equal value or not equal type
	x !== 5	false
x !== "5"	true
x !== 8	true

>	greater than
	x > 8	false

<	less than
  x < 8	true
>=	greater than or equal to
  x >= 8	false
<=	less than or equal to
  x <= 8	true
