<!-- introduction to javascript  -->

javascript is the world most popular programming language.
Javascript is the programming language for the web.
javascript is easy to learn

What Is JavaScript? JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.


*Javascript Variables :-

Variables are containers for storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

var Surname = 'Nonso';

In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.
They are automatically declared when first used:
Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

variable declare with var, can be re-declared and reassigned

When to use Var, let or const?
always declare variables
Always use const if the value should not be changed
Only use let if you can't use const


*JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.



*The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

x = x + 5

In JavaScript, however, This makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

Note
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

**JavaScript Data Types
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Object
8. Array

Note
A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.
The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

let x = 16 + "Volvo";

**JavaScript Strings
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:



assign 10 to a, assign 20 to b, assign the total to a constant variable c.

assign joseph to the a variable firstName, Morgan to the variable surname. assign joseph's full name to the variable fullName
log fullName to the console



1. Assign the string, i am a web developer, to a variable occupation.
then assign, 'and i like to code with javascript' to the variable hobby.
log to the console occupation adding the hobby string to occupation


2. do the sum of 1.5 and 4, then assign the sum to the variable x,
    deduct 10 from 52 and assign it to the variable y.
 then log to the console z adding x and y to the z contsant variable
